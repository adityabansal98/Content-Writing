Hello Readers,

Every one of you would have taken a ride on public transport buses🚌 or trains🚝. You might have observed that the person of old age is given priority over others.

Now let's say you have the responsibility of distribution of seats among people based on age which you already know, How will you do this task using programming?

> arrayOfAge = [9,4,6,8,5]

> numberOfSeats = 3

Alright, you might have guessed it correctly. Just Sort the array and pick 3 people with a maximum age.

📝What's the time complexity of this approach? 

🎯***O(n.log(n))***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But, Let's say there are m stops for the bus and at each stop, one person acquiring the seat leaves and another person enters the bus. To whom do you allot the seat? Will you do sorting again and again for each stop and allow the seat to the person with maximum age? Let's first analyze this approach...

Sorting for each stop will take ***O(n.log(n))*** time and doing it m times. So, the total time complexity will be ***O(m.n.log(n))***.

Now, We want to optimize the algorithm. Here comes our Data-Structure ***Priority-Queue or Heap***.

You might be wondering🤔, What's special in this data-structure?

The above algorithm could be solved in just ***O(m.log(n))***, Isn't it is much better than before😀?

Now Let's understand Priority Queue and how can it optimize our problem?
