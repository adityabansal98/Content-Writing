# INTRODUCTION

# Priority Queue (HEAP)

In the priority queue, an element with the highest priority served first then the rest of the elements. Basically, the elements are arranged in this data-structure based on priority. Priority could be of any type eg. maximum value, minimum value, etc. 

-------------------------

📝Think🤔 about how can we prioritise people in the example above?

🎯Hoping you already got it, We can prioritize people based on age i.e. the person with the maximum age🧓 should be given a seat first.

Heap satisfies the following properties:

1. The tree of a heap is a complete binary tree i.e. Height is always ***O(logn)***.
2. Heap follows the order of elements internally. E.g. In a Max-Heap, a parent's value is greater than equal to that of its children.

📝What is a complete binary tree?

🎯In a complete binary tree:

  - Every level is filled with nodes except the last.
  - Nodes are aligned from left to right.
  - So, the maximum height is log(N).
