# ENDING NOTE
    
Now, Let's get back to our example discussed at the starting of the blog.

The notion of that example is that at each stop the passenger of the highest age leaves the bus and the new passenger enters. So, At each stop, we have to allow the seat to the passenger with a maximum age.

So, how heap improves our algorithm🙄?

We can pop(leaving the bus) the passenger 🧍‍ from the heap in O(logn) time complexity and insert the new passenger in O(logn) time-complexity. So the *Overall time-complexity of our algorithm will be **O(m.log(n))***.

Hope you understood the heap and its operations🏆.

Thanks for reading.😊
