# OPERATIONS OF HEAP

Now, Let's have a look at the operations of the heap:

1. ***buildHeap***: From a given array, We can build a heap in *O(n)* time complexity.
2. ***insert***: Addition of an element to heap could be done in *O(logn)* time complexity.
3. ***pop***: Removes an element with the highest priority from the heap in *O(logn)* time complexity.
4. ***seek***: Returns highest priority element from the heap in *O(logn)* time complexity.
5. ***isEmpty***: Checks if the heap consists of any element in *O(1)* time complexity.
6. ***size***: Returns the count of the number of elements in heap in *O(1)* time complexity.
7. ***heapify***: Orders the heap on the index that violates the heap property in *O(logn)* time complexity.
8. ***deleteElement***: Removes the element from the heap in *O(n)* time complexity.
