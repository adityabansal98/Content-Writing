# Introduction

***Two Pointers*** Technique involves two pointers to keep track of indices and save time and space. Both pointers can move during the algorithm, but each pointer can move to one direction only.

We can combine two pointers in different traversal ways to express the complex algorithm logic.

Let's classify the application of this algorithm in six different ways:

***1. Left and right boundary***
