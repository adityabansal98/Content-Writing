# Sliding Window Approach

A **sliding window** is a constant-size subarray that moves from left to right through the array.
At each window position, we want to calculate some information about the elements inside the window.

Sliding window is a sub-list that runs over an underlying data-structure e.g. Array, Strings etc.

Let's take an array:

    [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]

A **Sliding Window** of size 3 runs over the array like this:

    1 2 3

      2 3 4

        3 4 5

          4 5 6

            5 6 7
